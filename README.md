# **Using ESP32 and ADXL345,combine a neural network to create a simple calculator**
In the project, we aim to use the ADXL345 to collect data. Subsequently, we will utilize this data to train a simple neural network. Upon completing the model,  use it for recognizing handwritten equations. Finally, the complete equation and its corresponding answer will be displayed on the terminal
